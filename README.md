# Chakra

![Chakra Logo](./assets/logo.png)

Chakra is a lightweight tool that lets you run WebAssembly (WASM) modules directly in your browser with zero configuration.

## Features

- üöÄ **Simple**: Just point Chakra at your .wasm file and go
- üåê **Browser-based**: Instantly opens your default browser
- üìä **Interactive console**: View execution results and logs
- üîç **Smart detection**: Identifies common entry points [slightly buggy]
- üß© **Diagnostic tools**: Helps troubleshoot WASM modules [TODO]

## Installation

### From Cargo (Recommended)

```sh
cargo install chakra
```

### From Source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anistark/chakra.git
cd chakra
cargo install --path .
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run a WebAssembly file directly:

```sh
chakra --path ./path/to/your/file.wasm
```

### Custom Port

Specify a custom port (default is `8420`):

```sh
chakra --path ./path/to/your/file.wasm --port 3000
```

### Stop Server

Stop any running Chakra server:

```sh
chakra stop
```

## How It Works

When you run Chakra with a WASM file:

1. It starts a lightweight HTTP server
2. Opens your default browser
3. Serves the WASM file along with a nice UI
4. Attempts to instantiate and run the WebAssembly module
5. Shows execution results and console logs

## Supported WASM Types

Chakra works best with:

- Simple C/C++ compiled WASM files
- Rust WASM files compiled without wasm-bindgen
- Any WASM that doesn't require extensive JavaScript bindings

For complex WASM modules (like those compiled with wasm-bindgen), Chakra will detect this and provide helpful information, but may not be able to execute them fully.

## Examples

### Running a simple C-compiled WASM file:

```sh
# Compile C to WASM (requires emscripten)
emcc -O2 hello.c -o hello.wasm

# Run with Chakra
chakra --path hello.wasm
```

### Running a simple Rust WASM file:

```sh
# Build a WASM file from Rust
cargo build --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --release

# Run with Chakra
chakra --path ./target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/yourapp.wasm
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Port is already in use"**: Try specifying a different port with `--port`
- **"No WASM entry point found"**: Your WASM file might not have standard entry points like `main()` or `_start()`
- **"This appears to be a wasm-bindgen module"**: Try using the original JavaScript loader that came with your WASM file
